## Notes

- Note: Naichen worked about 5 hrs for the project
- Com box on 9V -> 5V -> **3V**
  - Note: the raspberry pi work on 5V.
- Sensors's box on 5V
  - The resolution of the sensors is higher
- Define radio connectors for the LoRa module
  - [Antenna](https://www.sirioantenne.it/en/products/cellular/cx-840-cx-900)
  - SMA cable go-through (PCB to box wall) and male to male (box to antenna)

- Define radio go-through connectors
- Radio box specs
- Sensors' box specs
  - Naichen: instead of changing sensors in the box, replace the whole sensors' box. This idea actually make a lot of sense: sensors's box are given to the user for mounting; when aged the box is returned and sensors replaced by "manifacture" while a new sensors' box is provided.
