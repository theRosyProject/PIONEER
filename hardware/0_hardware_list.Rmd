# List of modules

## Box 1: Data Communication 

The data communication box will receive data (UART) from `Box 2: Data Collection` and will be powered (9V - 5V) with the `Box 3: Power Supply`.

The PCB have to be design to act both as `receiver` and `transceiver` and capable to plug-in commercial components:

- Raspberry Pi Zero ([3B+](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-3-model-b-plus/), [Zero](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-zero-2-w/)) 
- Arduino [Nano BLE](https://store-usa.arduino.cc/products/arduino-nano-33-ble?selectedStore=us)
- [ESP32-S3-MINI-1](https://www.adafruit.com/product/5477)
- [Feather Huzzah ESP8266](https://www.adafruit.com/product/2821)

Additional modules that should be integrated in the PCB:

- [LoRa 868MHz](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3072)
  - [alternative](https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/seeed-technology-co.,-ltd/109990166/7033232?utm_adgroup=RF%20Transceiver%20Modules&utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=Shopping_Product_RF%2FIF%20and%20RFID_NEW&utm_term=&utm_content=RF%20Transceiver%20Modules&gclid=CjwKCAjwpqCZBhAbEiwAa7pXeRL7nhQhQ7vTGvsG-45Smy6gd5Uc4cDUkz6kC4OnWObWKTFqP0Ql0xoCmRAQAvD_BwE)
- Temperature/Humidity/Pressure [BME280](https://www.adafruit.com/product/2652)
- [RTC](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3013)

The connectors that should be on the board:

- Power (USB-C) *Note: the connection should be protected inside the box, with a kind of internal "winding" of the wire to prevent detachment from the board
- [SMA (example)](https://www.adafruit.com/product/1865) 

Notes:

- 868 MHz antenna
